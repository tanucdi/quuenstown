              <p class="card-text">Hey ladies.<br>

                Did you just get a job offer in a city away from home? Are you wondering where you should stay in the city?
                
                While every city has a variety of accommodation options, ladies hostel has been a popular choice for single working women. A standard girl’s hostel is comparatively cheap and safe and usually offers shared accommodation with common areas for cooking, washing up dining, and entertainment.
                
                Wondering what it is like to stay in a ladies hostel in India? Just read on.
                <br>
               <strong> Hostel Rules </strong><br>
                If there is one common rule every girls’ hostel in India has, it is related to curfews. To ensure the safety of women, every women hostel has specific timelines by which the girls are mandated to return to the hostel premises (especially after sundown). This rule may, however, be difficult to follow by women working late hours. If you are one of them, then apply for special permission from your hostel warden, mentioning the reason for such a request. It is best to be transparent about when you will return from the beginning to avoid being locked out at night.
                
                While timing is a major concern for most women, the prohibition of overnight stay of guests may also irk girls who have friends and family members visiting the city.
                <br>
           <strong>   Privacy Does Not Matter</strong><br>
                A working women’s hostel has a lot of adult women living together. The experience is akin to having sisters in the house. In such a setting, you can expect them to be around you, regardless of the time and day.
                
                To understand how it feels like to live with a lot of sisters, here are some common situations you can expect
                Sharing is caring:
                From opinions to personal belongings, girls in the hostel do not shy away from sharing. So, if you are dressing up for a party or have suddenly finished all your sanitary napkins, you will easily find a helping hand in a ladies hostel. It is also completely normal to wax each other, make birthday cakes using water-drenched biscuits, and exchange clothes and accessories. And if you are in the mood to share your feelings, you would cook instant noodles with geyser water and settle for a late-night session.
                <br>
             <strong>   Learning important life lessons:</strong><br>
                Being single in the city and living in a hostel gives working women unforgettable experiences. It is more like a memorable adventure that enables you to not only overcome your own shortcomings and fears but also gives you a chance to develop long-lasting friendships. You also learn to be resourceful (like iron clothes with hot water glass bottles), gain new perspectives about different matters, and become a more mature human being.
                
                Unpleasant experiences are subjective:
                Every woman who has stayed in a women’s hostel has her own story to share. Any experience, either pleasant or unpleasant, is often very personal and might not have happened to others. Nonetheless, it is best to be aware and prepared. Situations like having an incompatible roommate, stolen belongings, tasteless hostel food, or inability to match the daily schedules with other hostel mates may leave you unhappy and uncomfortable. And if you are troubled with such issues, it is time you look for a better living option.
                
                We, at Nestaway, understand that finding a home away from home for single working women can be a challenge. This is why we have come up with affordable housing options for working women – either on a single or twin sharing basis. What’s more? Choose to rent a fully furnished apartment and you will also have all the amenities necessary to live a comfortable life.</p>

              <Staying class="card-text">Indore is an emerging educational hub of India that boasts of more than 40 universities; offering high-class education. Children from around the world come to study here, giving rise to a huge demand for student services. While most institutes provide economic residential hostels, there are fewer luxury stays in Indore for students looking for more comfortable/luxurious options. 

                Shoebox rooms and halls of residence that look like prisons are a thing of the past, let us delve into the need for these luxury hostels and discover an awesome luxurious student pad in Indore.
                <br>
             <strong>   Need for Luxury Hostels </strong><br>
                
                Staying away from family calls for greater care and better amenities than at home. Hostel isn’t just where you stay, it’s where you live. 
                
                Of late, there has been increasing demand from students and working professionals looking for a luxurious and comfortable environment with facilities they have been enjoying at home. 
                
                Today we shall explore a luxury student homestel in Indore – ‘Quuen's Town.’ 
                <br>
             <strong>   Why Quuen's Town? </strong><br>
                
                ‘True to its name’, Quuen's Town offers an exclusive portfolio of unique luxury rooms possessing exciting amenities. 
                
                Located in the Scheme Number 74 area in Indore, this luxury hostel in Indore caters to individuals who are looking for luxury at an affordable price.

              <h5 class="card-title"><a >Stay as close to the action as possible</a></h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                If you’ve travelled somewhere to surf then you should stay as close to the beach as possible, not a 30 minute bus away. Your work-life balance is important so try and stay as close as possible to what interests you in a destination. Having to work while we travel means that we can’t waste time commuting to do the things we enjoy. As you can see, there are quite a few things to consider when choosing a hostel. Most importantly the place should look comfortable and the internet connection should be strong, but other factors matter.
                <br>
          <strong>Location, location, location. </strong><br>
                One of the most attractive things about staying in a hostel – apart from the price – is the fact that they are quite often at the heart of where you want or need to be. There is no point in budgeting well for your accommodation if you have to spend a small fortune in transport costs. The best thing to do is have a location that you want to stay in before you arrive and then look at the range of accommodation in that area, rather than the other way around. It is also a good idea to see what amenities are close to the hostel you are looking at, ask yourself if it is within walking distance of a train or MRT station, or close to a 7/11 or grocery shop for example. These aren’t essential, of course, but they can make life much simpler for you. 
                <br>
                <strong>Security. </strong><br>
                Probably one of the most important things to consider is if the hostel has good security or not. The exact details can vary wildly as hostels can be uniquely different from place to place, but a good one should have at the very least a basic level of security. Check if they have good sized lockers for your pack, a good secure luggage storage room, good locks on individual shower doors or manned front desks for example. All good hostels have a good level of security as standard, and if the hostel you are looking at doesn’t? Then move on. There will be a dozen more hostels within walking distance that do.
                <br>
                <strong>Cleanliness. </strong><br>
                I have to admit this has become more of a consideration as I have aged and made more of a transition to occasional flashpacker, and your own tolerance levels of what you find acceptable will be unique to you alone, but I have seen hostels out there that I would not let an animal stay in, never mind myself. It just isn’t worth it if it looks as if you will catch something just by looking at the shower! Thankfully a great many hostels have really upped their game in recent years and there are some now that are better and cheaper options than a lot of budget hotels, and they are usually no more expensive than the dingy, unclean options! When you are looking around, just peek into the showers and communal kitchen if they have one and see if the standards of cleanliness are acceptable

              <h5 class="card-title"><a >Here's Why Girl's Hostel Life Is Always Fun!</a></h5>
              <p class="card-text">The word “Hostel” may not sound too exciting, but a life at the hostel is totally different and filled with loads of memories! Hostel life gives a chance to explore ourselves and to be independent. To be away from home and to do crazy stuff is what makes hostel life even more special!
                <br>
            <strong >   Washroom blues </strong> <br>
Hostels are mostly living together with two or more people and sharing common amenities with your roomies is a must. Similarly, washroom is one among those common facilities which you need to share with roommates or with people in the same floor. The days begin with long queues outside each washroom. Sometimes, there might be water shortage also. Using washroom in hostel according to our convenience is actually a big deal!
<br>
<strong>Usage of technology </strong> <br>
You might be a crazy fan of a serial or a talk show. You don’t actually miss any of your favourite shows! If you are staying in a hostel, do you think you will miss out on all these activities? Not really! Technology will definitely save you. Your boring laptop suddenly turns out to be the most important thing like literally, your best friend! You can watch all your TV shows by connecting the internet to your laptop without missing any show and also with your friends.
<br>
<strong>Gossips</strong><br>
Here comes the most exciting part of the discussion! Every college has certain gossips and even every single group, in particular, maintains secrets and chit chat among themselves. The late night gossip conventions are the best part when we end up having more than ten interesting topics to discuss. From commenting about others and drooling over the new professor, a gang of girls together is enough to do it all!
<br>
<strong>What's there to hide?</strong><br>
Dressing up and trying out new clothes is one of the major attraction that pulls most of the girls' attention towards it. Exchanging dresses with your roomie and seeing a trial in front of them is actually not a big deal! Due to the lack of privacy and space in hostel rooms, it leaves with no choice other than moving around in bare minimum clothes in front of roommates. And in a place where only girls are present, it turns out to be a daily routine!
<br>
<strong>Male specie is so rare</strong><br>
Yet another crucial part that makes every girls' eye’s eagerly look out for is spotting a male specie! It’s a definite no-no for a male to enter girls' hostel! But if found, it becomes a major talk for the late night chats with girls.
<br>
<strong>Independent life</strong><br>
The biggest advantage of staying in a hostel is that you learn to be independent and manage every work of yours! You don’t have to depend on anyone anymore. You are exposed to a situation where you learnt to handle all yourself. Hostel life actually turns out to be the best part of life!
